**Stakeholders**
Stakeholder engagement is a principal component to the development of our toolkit. The ACLU and the Community Centered Tech Coalition are the two stakeholders central to our project. We are engaging with them through face-to-face meetings to gain insight into their mission and work with tech fairness policy. In our meetings, we try to build a better sense of the methods in which they do their work to guide our design process of the prototypes for our toolkit elements. We are taking into consideration the concerns they express for the impact that algorithmic bias has on their community of interest and striving to strike a balance between addressing their specific needs and keeping the toolkit applicable to the general community.

We envision our stakeholders using our toolkit to better inform their activism efforts in regards to tech fairness policy. We foresee community members and organization leaders using the toolkit to aid their understanding of algorithmic bias and the use of algorithmic systems in both society at large and specifically in the City of Seattle.
