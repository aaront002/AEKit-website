# Algorithmic Equity Toolkit Website

These markdown files were used to create the [Algorithmic Equity Toolkit Website](https://uwescience.github.io/AEKit-website/).

In an era of increasing technological advancement, our society now has more access than ever to information and data analysis tools. Algorithmic tools and systems have been introduced to help us process and interpret the multitude of data that our society now has access to. Extensive evidence demonstrates that the harms of algorithmic and information technologies are significant. Several systems such as automated bail decisions, facial recognition, algorithmically-supported hiring decisions have been found to have racial and gender bias.

The Algorithmic Equity Toolkit team worked with the ACLU and other civil rights stakeholders to develop a toolkit which will help civil rights advocates understand what Automated Decision Systems and surveillance tools are, how they work, and what the potential harms are. With this toolkit, we aim to empower civil rights advocates to engage in discussions surrounding the introduction and management of new algorithmic and surveillance tools and systems that may potentially harm their communities.
